## Procedures for handling abuse

Our group has a policy of treating everyone with respect and fairness. If a group member interacts with another member in an abusive manner, the following procedure will be enforced:
1. Discuss the issues with the group member and provide a warning
2. Monitor group members behaviour to ensure improved behaviour
3. If neglect continues, the group member will be provided a second warning
4. If behaviour still doesn't improve, other authourites (Dr. Moosvi and/or TA's) will be consulted and appropriate consequences will be executed.
