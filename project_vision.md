# Project Vision

Given the increasing advocacy towards mental health and mental health support, we aim to explore how music may impact mental wellbeing, considering the perspectives of diverse age groups and how influential music has been in their daily lifestyle. Utilizing our findings, we hope to produce detailed, thoroughly developed, and comprehensive data visualizations that can aid the general public in understanding the influence of music on their mental health. As a dedicated team of students who have experienced our own mental hurdles, our team intends to use this project to provide a greater understanding of mental health with respect to music. 

Diverse genres are examined such as classical, country, EDM, folk, gospel, hip hop, jazz, K pop, Latin, lofi, metal, pop, R&B, rap, pop, and video game music which have varying influences on mental health. Furthermore the respondents connection to music such as whether they play an instrument or are a composer is studied as well. It will be worthwhile to investigate how all the different variables in this dataset, including the genres of music and overall involvement with music, affect the various mental health attributes in individuals.
