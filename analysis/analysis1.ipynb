I will clean my data by checking for any missing values and if there are any incorrect data that is beyond the range of interest. If there are any outliers, I will indicate as such and deal with these appropriately. I plan on adding an additional column \"neither\" to count the number of those who are not composing or playing an instrument by doing groupBy. I may also add an overall mental health analysis in the form of a percentage by doing some further data manipulation. Finally, I will visualize said data in the most appropriate manner after a few different experimentations.\n",

Once again, I will create a new aggregate column of those who are neither an instrumentalist or a composer. I will have to remove any of the NaN values of music effects and check any of the other columns for incorrect or missing data. I will also plan on dealing with any outliers and noting this as well. I will count the total number of those who have felt that music has had an improvement and compare it between those who are a composer, instrumentalist or neither.
