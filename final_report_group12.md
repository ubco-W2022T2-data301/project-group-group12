## Introduction

Given the increasing advocacy towards mental health and mental health support, we primarily aimed to explore how music may impact mental wellbeing, considering the influence of diverse music genres, amount of music listening, and extent of involvement with music. Eventually, we decided to explore the correlation of some additional factors to mental health as well, to further enrich our project. Utilizing our findings, we have produced detailed, comprehensive data visualizations that will aid the general public in understanding the influence of music and additional factors on their mental health.  


## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Question 1 + Results
**What is the relationship between the active participation of music in one's lifestyle (composing, playing an instrument, listening to music on a greater than average amount, or neither) in relation to the severity of mental health disorders among these individuals? How do these factors influence how they percieve the effect of music?**

Graph 2: Overall mental health based on hours of music listened to per day.

Graph 3: Type of Music Participation and percieved effects of music.

Based on the graphs demonstrated above, there is no correlation between those who participate in different types of music and their reported severity in their overall mental health. This is shown in the violin chart, where the data is pretty much centered around the 4-7 range in terms of overall mental health score for each group of individuals. In addition, there is also no correlation between the amount of music listened to per day and the overall mental health of an individual. This can be seen in the hex-plot graph, where the overall mental health is pretty much evenly distributed for each hour of music listened to per day. Despite this, it can be seen that the type of music participation can affect how the music effects on mental health is percieved. Those who are composers tend to report that music improved their mental health moreso compared to those who did not participate in music composing or playing. However, it can be seen in the heat map that all three groups percieve music to have a positive effect on their mental health in general.

During EDA, I made the overall mental health plots. explain why I kept outliers, and why I made individual plots for each mental health condition instead of keeping it as one. 

### Research Question 1:

**Do either an individual’s age or the amount of music they listen to have an effect on their mental health; which one has a stronger correlation with which mental health problem?**

(Use tableau plots bc more concise)

As visualized in Figure #, ___ 

<img src ="images/name.png" width="750px" class="center">
<br>
As visualized in Figure #+1, ___ 


Now that we know this, a sub-question I want to explore is:

**Sub-question: How much of the day do most individuals usually spend listening to music- what is the “mode” value of this aspect?**

Maybe use the tableau plot. Could also use IQR range?

<br>
As visualized in Figure #+2, ___ 

This is relatively low so that’s good! I also want to explore one more sub-question: 

Of the four mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, OCD, and insomnia), which one is the most prevalent?

(Show the box plot)

<img src ="images/name.png" width="750px" class="center">
<br>
As visualized in Figure #+3, ___ 



Based on our earlier conclusion that the quantity of music listening and mental health problems have a positive correlation. Based on these previous questions, it can be seen that overall, people rank their mental health problems quite high on the scale, especially their anxiety and depression. Thus, it suggests that even though a lot of people are listening to music for only around 8.3% (and __) of their days, they should try to further lessen this number as this may help bring down their mental health problems. 


Ok now. The first set of research questions yielded very interesting results. Since depression and anxiety are the two most prevalent mental health conditions based on the box plot, and we learned that younger populations tend to suffer more, i thought i’d explore to see what other factors may be contributors. Young populations often include students, so I found a dataset on student mental health. This dataset correlates anxiety and depression presence to year level and CGPA. I wanted to learn if either of these factors possibly contribute to anxiety and depression:

### Research Question #2:

**What correlation do the academic factors of "Year level" and "CGPA" (cumulative GPA) have with depression and anxiety?**

Include the 4 bar plots from analysis file to show this for the 2x2 conditions 


(explanation of plots from analysis file)


### Research Question #3:

**Does the choice of primary streaming service of music have a correlation with mental health?**

Use Tableau tables to show what the highest and lowest levels of problems are in which users (average-based)

Use plots from analysis file (heatmaps) to show the modes? Like “for anxiety the mode falls at 7 for all service-users but for depression, the mode is about 7 for all but 3 for pandora!”


In conlusion, the datasets have yielded lots of fascinating trends. ___ (summarize)
Correlation does not imply causation. Also having more participants will allow for more accurate results.
