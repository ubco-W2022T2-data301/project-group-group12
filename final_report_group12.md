- Here are the **suggested sections** of your Final Report:
    - **Introduction**: A short paragraph introducing your project to the audience and a motivation for why this project is important. It's fine to say your group has an interest in this topic and were keen to explore it more.
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A summary of the **highlights** of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.
    - **Question 1 + Results**: Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.
    - **Question 2 + Results**: Same as above.
    - **Question 3 + Results**: Same as above.
    - **Summary/Conclusion**: A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project.


## Introduction

Given the increasing advocacy towards mental health and mental health support, we primarily aimed to explore how music may impact mental wellbeing, considering the influence of diverse music genres, amount of music listening, and extent of involvement with music. Eventually, we decided to explore the correlation of some additional factors to mental health as well, to further enrich our project. Utilizing our findings, we have produced detailed, comprehensive data visualizations that will aid the general public in understanding the influence of music and additional factors on their mental health.
