- Here are the **suggested sections** of your Final Report:
    - **Introduction**: A short paragraph introducing your project to the audience and a motivation for why this project is important. It's fine to say your group has an interest in this topic and were keen to explore it more.
    - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: A summary of the **highlights** of your EDA, where you can show some visualizations of the exploratory data analysis your group did.
    - **Question 1 + Results**: Clearly state your research question, and include 2-3 visualizations that helped you answer your research question. You can create multi-panel figures, but each of your visualizations must speak directly to your research question, and any insights you were able to get from it should be clearly articulated in the figure caption/description.
    - **Question 2 + Results**: Same as above.
    - **Question 3 + Results**: Same as above.
    - **Summary/Conclusion**: A brief paragraph that highlights your key results and what you learned from doing this project.


## Introduction

Given the increasing advocacy towards mental health and mental health support, we primarily aimed to explore how music may impact mental wellbeing, considering the influence of diverse music genres, amount of music listening, and extent of involvement with music. Eventually, we decided to explore the correlation of some additional factors to mental health as well, to further enrich our project. Utilizing our findings, we have produced detailed, comprehensive data visualizations that will aid the general public in understanding the influence of music and additional factors on their mental health.  


## Exploratory Data Analysis


## Question 1 + Results
**What is the relationship between the active participation of music in one's lifestyle (composing, playing an instrument, listening to music on a greater than average amount, or neither) in relation to the severity of mental health disorders among these individuals? How do these factors influence how they percieve the effect of music?**

Based on the graphs demonstrated above, there is no correlation between those who participate in different types of music and their reported severity in their overall mental health. This is shown in the violin chart, where the data is pretty much centered around the 4-7 range in terms of overall mental health score for each group of individuals. In addition, there is also no correlation between the amount of music listened to per day and the overall mental health of an individual. This can be seen in the hex-plot graph, where the overall mental health is pretty much evenly distributed for each hour of music listened to per day. Despite this, it can be seen that the type of music participation can affect how the music effects on mental health is percieved. Those who are composers tend to report that music improved their mental health moreso compared to those who did not participate in music composing or playing. However, it can be seen in the heat map that all three groups percieve music to have a positive effect on their mental health in general.
